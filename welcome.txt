## Welcome to Public VNC Resolver!
This appears to be your first time using the bot, so thank you very much for using it ^^.

Public VNC Resolver is a Discord bot dedicated to showcasing all the insecure VNCs across the world, using [ComputerNewb's VNC Resolver](<https://computernewb.com/vncresolver/>) API.
				
I advise to **not** connect to any of the VNCs displayed here. Most of them are pretty old so they are offline, but the ones that are still online could be a [Honeypot](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot_(computing)>). I am not responsible if anything bad happens.
